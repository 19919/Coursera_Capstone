In this lab I will use the Foursquare Data via the API. I will use the basic calls to find out what kind of establishments there are in one are and then use
clustering to see how that data compares to other regions in the dataset.

I will also utilize data from St. Louis Fed on income per County, which I will use as a proxy for cost of living. The link to the data can be found below.
