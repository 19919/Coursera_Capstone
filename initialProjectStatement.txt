Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute.
Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem,
so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

Everybody has a dream place where they want to live, but as housing prices have skyrockeded during the past years, the area where one ideally would want to live, 
may not be in range when it comes to affordability. In this project, I try to mitigate some of that issue by providing
a framework where a person who has seen their dream area but think it's too expensive, can see what other areas that are similar, but cheaper.

For the purpose of this lab i limit i limit my selection to the west coast of the US, with my favourite area set to seattle. I crudley proxy the cost of living with the median
household income, and assume it's strongly correlated.

As data points I will use the Foursquare data as described in the previous labs and then also utilize income data from St. Louis Fed (https://geofred.stlouisfed.org/map/?th=reds&cc=5&rc=false&im=fractile&sb&lng=-90.00&lat=39.98&zm=4&sl&sv&am=Average&at=Not%20Seasonally%20Adjusted,%20Annual,%20Dollars,%20no_period_desc&sti=1019&fq=Annual&rt=county&un=lin&dt=2019-01-01)
